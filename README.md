# Automate API Extraction & Data Appending

## Overview
This project automates the process of:
1. **Extracting data from APIs**  
2. **Appending extracted data** into structured datasets  
3. **Enhancing datasets with additional transformations and enrichment**  

The solution is designed for scalability and repeatability, reducing manual intervention in recurring API data ingestion workflows.
